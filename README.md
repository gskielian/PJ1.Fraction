CSC220 Programming Project#1
============================
 
Due Date: 11:55pm, Wed, 3/5/2014, upload textfile Fraction.java to ilearn

- You need to implement Fraction class which is within package PJ1
  See `PJ1/Fraction.java` and `PJ1/FractionInterface.java` for specifications

- Use `PJ1_Test.java` to test correctness of your program

- Compile programs (you are in directory containing Readme file):
	
```bash
  javac PJ1/*.java
  javac PJ1_Test.java
```

- Run programs (you are in directory containing Readme file):

  // Run tests in Fraction class
```bash
  java PJ1.Fraction	
```
  // Run main test program
```bash
  java PJ1_Test		
```

- Note: For some systems, you may require 

```bash
  javac -cp . PJ1_Test.java
  java -cp . PJ1.Fraction	
  java -cp . PJ1_Test
```

- Bonus (25%): Implement GUI test program
  
  Before implemeting GUI test program, 
  your program must work for all test cases using PJ1_Test.

  Talk to me before you start this part.
